Welcome to Day 1 of 30 Days to Be a Better Networker! First up? Defining your career story.

The Power of Storytelling
Storytelling is perhaps the most essential interview skill. If someone is able to clearly communicate both how they can help me and why they’re passionate about what they do, I sit up and take notice.

A compelling narrative can neutralize the negative effects of resume “problems” -- like long periods of unemployment or frequent job hopping. After all, who can blame you for relentlessly pursuing a dream, though it led you down an unconventional path?

The Biggest Networking Mistake
Whenever I’m at a networking event and I ask what someone does, I cringe if it goes like this,

“I’m a [Job Title] for [Company].”

 It’s a factually correct answer, but there’s no “there” there. When I’m asking about someone’s work, I’m really asking, “What are you passionate about? Who do you serve? Why? How do you make the world a better place?”

“What do you do?” is just the…less intense way of saying it.

When you network, it’s up to you to provide all of that context upfront. Your story, when told well, invites conversation and connection. By speaking to your own deep motivations, you can connect meaningfully with people you’ve just met.
