So, how did your meeting go? Whether you got exactly what you needed or not, you’ve got one job right now.

## Say thank you.

This is going to be a quick email, because it’s really that straightforward. Somebody awesome took time out of their day to help you with your career, and that’s a real gift. Time to make your grandma proud and say thanks.

# Your Assignment
[Read this blog post][blog] for inspiration, and send a thank you email to the person you spoke with.

**Extra Credit**: Make it a handwritten note on nice cardstock (those stamps must be buried somewhere…)

Best,<br>
T.J.

**Up Next**: Friday is our final lesson (so sad!) We’re going to look forward at your next big networking move...live events.
