Today’s the day! The last assignment in your 30 Day Networking Challenge. (Hey, we finished early! I’m a little sad to see it end, but all good things do.)

I hope that you’ve felt stretched to try new approaches to networking, and have grown a little more confident. This is a skill that’s worth practicing your whole life long — after all, **meeting new people and helping them out doesn’t stop when you retire**.

Today I’m going to challenge you to step outside of your comfort zone, and check out a networking event.

## Not just business cards and cocktails.

I know, I know. Networking events might sound boring or heinous, or both. A bunch of people scanning the room, always looking for the most powerful or important person they can find.

Yuck.

But you don’t operate that way. **You’re not there to build power or prestige**. You’re just going to see who you can meet, share what you know, and learn more about your industry.  Like-minded people will gravitate to that openness.

So don’t sweat it. Success is showing up, and having a real conversation.

## Where to go?

I find worthwhile events a couple of different ways. Word of mouth is always great — if you know any social butterflies, ask them about what events might be good for you.

I also like to use [Meetup] to find industry events. Often these will include a talk or a panel, so it’s not just strangers mixing awkwardly — there’s built-in value (and conversation fodder). [Eventbrite] also hosts networking events.

But **perhaps the best thing to do is get clued in to your local alumni association**. Alumni events are a great opportunity to meet people from different industries, all with something powerful in common — that shared school connection.

# Your Assignment:
Find a networking event that looks interesting. Put it on your calendar. Don’t chicken out at the last minute (you’ve got this.) [Read this blog post][blog] for tips on how to keep the conversation going, and download [this printable question card][worksheet] if you want a cheat sheet.

**Extra credit**: Subscribe to your local alumni association mailing list. And of course, keep an eye out for cool alums on [BrightCrowd].

Best,<br>
T.J.

**Next week**: We’ll think back on what we learned. With tears in our eyes and a song in our hearts, perhaps?
