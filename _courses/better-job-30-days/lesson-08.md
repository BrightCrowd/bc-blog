All right. Today’s the day.

You’ve got the goods (that stellar resume, web presence, and [message template][doc 1]), now you’re going to share them with the world. We’re going to start slow, by messaging a group that’s highly likely to have your back — alumni.

There’s [something pretty special about alumni connections][blog 1]. You might have shared memories, you’ll know the same traditions and same geography.

All this is awesome for forging a connection, even with a perfect stranger. [Here’s how to send a winning message][blog 2] to people who share your alma mater. Now you’re going to put the theory into practice.

## Here’s how you’ll get there (in 5 steps).

1. Go to [BrightCrowd], of course.
2. **Browse or Search** for folks in your area, or in your field. When you see somebody interesting...
3. **Read all about them** (use Google, if there’s not enough information on their BrightCrowd profile). Find out what they’re like, and if you have any common interests or background.
4. **Customize your message** (remember, the ones from Monday?) to include something about them — the reason you reached out, or a shout-out to something you’ve got in common (in addition to your alma mater, of course).
5. **Hit send**. You did it!

# Today’s Assignment:

Send 3 messages to alumni on [BrightCrowd], asking for a quick informational interview or phone call.

**Extra Credit**: Why stop there? If you see more than 3 cool people who’d be great to speak with, message them. Not everyone will reply, so don’t get too worried if you don’t hear back. It’s appropriate to send a follow-up message in a week, but if there’s still no reply, [let it go][video 1].

Best,\
T.J.

**Up Next**: Keep on expanding your professional circle, by reaching out to people in your industry.
