The hard work is almost over.  You put yourself out there, maybe scheduled a meeting or two. Now all you’ve got to do is show up.

(Well, not quite.)

## Why prepare?

Being well-prepared for your informational interview isn’t just an important sign of professionalism. It can help you get the information you need, make the most of everyone’s time, and get you where you need to go.

If you’re making a career shift, you’ll have different questions than if you’re just starting out.  The questions you ask can help direct the conversation toward topics that are most relevant to your situation.

**When I’m going to have a call with someone I always write out my goals for the call, and the questions I need to ask to gather that information**.  It helps keep the conversation on track and ensures I get what I need out of the call.  

I know I could talk forever about career stuff (have you noticed?) — it’s helpful to narrow down the conversation. The great thing is, **prep should only take 15-30 minutes**, and it’ll make your interview 100% more effective.

# Your Assignment:
[Follow this checklist][worksheet] to make sure you’re ready for your interview. Brainstorm 5-10 questions you can ask (in case the conversation isn’t flowing naturally). No shame in using your notes. :)

**Extra Credit**: Ask your friends about how they handle informational interviews. They might have advice and experiences they can share that will help you get ready.

Best,  
T.J.

**Up Next**: Wednesday we’ll be talking gratitude. It’s an essential part of networking, just want to make sure we’ve got it covered!
