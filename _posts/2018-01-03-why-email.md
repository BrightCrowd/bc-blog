We’re asked pretty frequently why Gmail data is the thing that makes [BrightCrowd][brightcrowd] tick. The first (and maybe most obvious) is that it saves you a ton of time.

Can you imagine having to recreate your professional & social networks from scratch? I know, we’re breaking out in hives too. We love you too much to ruin your day like that.

If you’re like us, you’re addicted to Gmail (I’ve personally been a devoted user since 2005). It’s intuitive, it’s powerful, you never seem to run out of storage...we’re big fans.

This level of devotion leads to really high-quality information.

Chances are you’ve emailed not just employers and coworkers, but friends, family, band-mates, and that guy you did a project with senior year. Everybody who might be smart to connect with again is right there in your email history.  

##### But what about my privacy on BrightCrowd?

We hear you - and we take your privacy really seriously. Nobody ever reads your emails, and we never share your information. BrightCrowd analyzes your aggregated data to help you get connected with the right people. That’s it.

Because your email is a unique identifier, your contact list is all BrightCrowd needs to place you in a global social map. In moments, you can be get in touch with all the wonderful folks just 2 degrees of separation away. That’s tens of thousands of people, not so far removed.

In short, email is a valuable tool, in more ways than you thought. Gmail, I know you get tired of hearing this, but we love you. <3
