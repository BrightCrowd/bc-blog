If you’ve found yourself in a career you love at exactly the right company, that’s awesome.

Seriously -- your success is a big deal! But even while you push yourself to go farther, we hope you take a second to reflect on how far you’ve come.

**Most importantly, ask yourself this: how you can help others in your field with less experience?**

Even if you don’t feel like you’ve “made it” yet, you might still have a ton to offer folks who are coming up behind you.

For example -- if you’ve launched your business in the last year, you’re still learning (that’s for sure!) But you’ll have a ton of great information to share with people who are still day-jobbing. You have a lot to offer somebody considering taking the entrepreneurial leap, even if you don’t feel like you’ve mastered your market quite yet.

Stop thinking in the success/failure binary. You’ve got a lot to offer, already. And remember -- generosity breeds generosity. It’s likely this will all come back around. Here are some ways you can incorporate this “pay it forward” ethic into your regular work life.

# Make time in your week for mentorship.

Hear us out. We know “mentor” has a lot of connotations around commitment, but really, mentorship can be as simple as you need it to be.

Mentorship can mean a quick coffee break. An email check-in. A conversation at lunch. You don’t have to devote massive amounts of time to giving back. We like to call this approach a “[micro-consult][blog1]”.

Even if you’re stressed, you’ve got time in your week for a short help session with someone who needs it. Though the immediate payoff might not be apparent, these points of connection can open up hidden opportunities over time. Just stay consistent, and remember that networking is a long game.

If you’re looking to connect with potential mentees (or mentors -- we never stop learning!), run a quick search on your [university directory on BrightCrowd][search].

# Blog about what you know.

If you like writing, a blog might be a wonderful way to share your best advice with the world.

If you’re feeling intimidated, or struggling to come up with content, we’ve got your back.

If you’ve found yourself answering the same questions several times, that’s definitely post-worthy. Think about tiny details of your business -- things that you’ve done so many times that it’s second nature. You had to learn it somehow. Sometimes articulating something small and obvious (to you!) can be crazy valuable advice to someone else.

# Take advantage of complementary knowledge.

Sharing your knowledge at networking events or conferences isn’t a purely generous act. It’s an exchange. You’d be surprised at how if you share what you know, others are happy to reciprocate.
If the thought of putting yourself out there in this way is tough, check out [our tips for networking questions][blog2] that can help break the ice!

If you’re feeling shy and want to build yourself up to a big event, start by reaching out to your friends and people you know well. Let them know you’re thinking of them, and offer to help. You might discover that they’ve got knowledge that rocks your world.

The long and short of it? We can’t be experts at everything. Share what you’re great at, help people on their way. Good vibes all around.
