Social media gets a bad rap these days, and it’s not hard to understand why. There’s a platform for every self-promotional purpose, from big career moves to the smoothie you had for breakfast. Scrolling through someone’s “perfect” Instagram feed can feel demoralizing, and the pressure to measure up seems to be growing.
We want to break out of the self-promotion arms race. That’s why [BrightCrowd][brightcrowd] was born.

> BrightCrowd is a professional network that’s not about showing off, it’s about showing up.

BrightCrowd is a platform designed to spark authentic interactions. Here you don’t have to carefully construct an online persona — you simply offer help with whatever you’re good at. Professionals giving and receiving help freely and moving forward together; it’s like networking, but a lot kinder.

This a rare online community where it’s good to be vulnerable. Everyone has had challenges, and everyone is here to help. We don’t care about “likes”, and nobody has “followers.” Leave your duckface at the door, as winning as it is.


Being vulnerable, being present, and helping others. That’s what real professional networking is all about. It’s not just job searching and resume swapping, it’s building real relationships that will support you down the road.

BrightCrowd is all about helping you make those vital connections. By simply asking for help or offering advice, you’ll make real connections with people who will help move you forward. All you have to do is share what you’re passionate about, and we’ll introduce you to your incredible extended professional network: your friends’ friends, folks from your school, and talented people in your industry. You might be surprised by how supportive your network can be.

Opportunity rarely comes knocking all on its own; you’ve got to open the door a crack first. So let BrightCrowd help you you do just that.
