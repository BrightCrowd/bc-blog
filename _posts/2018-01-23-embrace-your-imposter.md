[Imposter syndrome][link1] can be a beast. At the beginning of the school year I got an email from an incoming freshman at Stanford, who was suffering from a classic case. She had decided to pursue a Computer Science major, but was feeling afraid of approaching professors and research groups to ask for work.

The reason? She didn’t have an extensive background in CS already, just a high school class and some self-teaching. She felt completely intimidated by her classmates, who all seemed to have the knowledge she lacked.

**She asked me point blank - how could she overcome her imposter syndrome?**

Her email struck a chord with me. Even though I’ve got three Ivy League degrees, sometimes I worry that I’ll be found out as a fraud. The fear that you’re not as smart as people think is ubiquitous among high-achievers.

So my first word of advice to this Stanford student?

**You are totally normal. Feeling outmatched is par for the course. Everybody goes through it.**

Experts agree. L.V. Anderson writes in her [Slate article on imposter syndrome][link2]:

> “...moderate impostorism might just be a sign that you’re a normal, mildly insecure, conscientious person.”

In other words, perfect confidence isn’t an asset. Mild imposter syndrome might just be a side-effect of healthy self-awareness. It can be helpful to know that feelings of being an imposter persist across all demographic groups - not just women in STEM fields. The problem is when we let those feelings hold us back.

Here’s where this student will have a real advantage. Now she knows that *everybody* feels like an imposter sometimes. The knowledge that you’re not alone can be a real superpower. It lets you walk through the world knowing that everybody who intimidates you has felt the same.

**To anybody who’s feeling like an imposter - you’ve made it where you are for a reason.**

You’ll figure out the rest soon enough. Just remember that *everybody* on Earth is still figuring things out, whether it be at school, a new job, or any other life adventures.

And if you’ve overcome imposter syndrome, we’d love to hear your advice. Please share it with the [helpful community on BrightCrowd][brightcrowd].
